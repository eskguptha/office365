Office 365 Authentication
For Office 365 Sharepoint is just as easy. The Office365 class grabs a login token from Microsoftâ€™s login servers then It logins the Sharepoint site and uses the cookie for Authentication. Make sure to put just the root url for the site in Office365 and add Https:// at start.
